# Baby reverse

### Question
```
Hey there!

Disclaimer: This chall is intended for new gamers only ;-)! You veterans got plenty of other Challenges which will keep you busy, so please pass this Challenge to someone, who never or rarely reversed before! We encourage everyone who never reversed anything to try this challenge. We believe in you and your future reversing skills =). You CAN do it!

The task is to find the correct input which will be the flag. See the challenge files for more instructions.
